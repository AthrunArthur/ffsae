ffsae - readme
============
This is a sequential version of SAE, a deep learning algorithm. ffsae is written with C++.

###1. Requirements
ffsae is not a lib building from scratch. We leverage many existing libs, make sure you have these libs in your system. It's better to know them if you wanna involve in development of ffsae

	1. blaze 2.0 - a C++ based math library;
	2. matio - a C++ lib to read/write .mat(MATLAB) files;
	3. boost - a general purpose C++ library;
	4. BLAS - optional, Basic Linear Algorithm Set, this is required by blaze for high performance. We prefer ATLAS and GotoBLAS

To build sae, we also need some other requirements:
	
	1. C++11 compatiable compiler - like gcc4.8 or clang3.4
	2. scons - a building system used by ffsae
	3. python 2.7 or higher - script language used by scons

###2. How to build it
blabla....

Hope we can finish this project ASAP and enjoy building this amazing thing.
